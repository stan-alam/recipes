# Alappanu (ABV 7.2%)
Origin: Kalhu 864 BC
Prep time: 40 minutes
Cook time: 2 hours 30 minutes
Fermentation time: 10 days
Makes: 1 gallon (4 L)
Original gravity 1.070 and final gravity 1.015


## Equipment
Sanitizer
Thermometer
2 nylon / nut milk bags
Funnel
Hydrometer or refractometer
Scissors
1¼-gallon (5 L) fermentation vessel
Fermentation lock
Auto-siphon
Twelve 11-ounce (330 ml) brown glass bottles
Sanitize all equipment thoroughly before you begin brewing. Follow the instructions for
the sanitizer you’re using. If your equipment has come into contact with anything
besides the beer, sanitize it again before it touches the beer. Failure to sanitize properly
can allow bacteria to enter the beer, leading to off-flavors that can affect the final result.

## Ingredients
7 quarts and ½ cup (7 L) bottled water
11 cups (1250 g) barley base malt
1¼ cups (300 ml) pomegranate juice
½ cup and 1 tablespoon (200 g) honey
6 tablespoons ground juniper berries
1 teaspoon yeast (lactic acid producing yeast)


# Instructions
1. Heat 5 quarts and 1 cup (5 L) of the water in a large pot to 144°F (62°C),
using a thermometer to monitor the temperature.
2. Place the malt in a nylon bag, lower it into the pot, and cover. Allow it to
steep for 30 minutes, occasionally checking to ensure the temperature
remains 144°F (62°C).
3. After 30 minutes, increase the heat to 162°F (72°C) and steep for an
additional 30 minutes, still covered.
4. In a separate pot, boil the remaining 1 quart and 3½ cups (2 L) of water and
set it aside.
5. Lift the nylon bag from the first pot and let any excess water drain back
into it. While holding the nylon bag over the first pot, take the boiling
water from the second pot and slowly pour it over the bag. This will help
extract any remaining flavor from the malt. Once done, remove and
discard the nylon bag.
6. Bring the liquid to a boil. Allow to boil for 45 minutes, uncovered.
7. Add the pomegranate juice and honey and boil for another 35 minutes.
8. Place the juniper berries in a new nylon bag, add the bag to the pot, and
boil for another 10 minutes.
9. Remove the nylon bag and turn off the heat.
10. Fill the sink (or a container large enough to hold the pot) with cold water,
and place the pot in the water to cool down the liquid to 77°F (25°C). Be
careful to ensure that nothing comes into contact with the liquid during
cooling.
11. If you’d like, you can now measure the liquid’s OG (original gravity) with a
refractometer or hydrometer before fermentation, and the FG (final
gravity) with a hydrometer after 10 days to calculate the exact alcohol
content—this beer’s OG should be 1.070 and FG 1.015. Note that these
values are approximate and may vary based on exact ingredients and
conditions. It is fine to skip this step if you want to keep it simple.
12. Use the funnel to transfer the beer from the pot to the fermentation
vessel.
13. Sanitize the yeast packet before you open it, and pour the yeast into the
fermentation vessel. Seal the jar with the fermentation lock. Let the yeast
rest on top of the mixture for a few minutes, then gently shake the vessel.
14. Allow the beer to ferment in a dark place for 10 days.
15. Fill the bottles with the beer using the auto-siphon or a funnel.
16. Store the beer in a cool, dark place at 50°F–59°F (10°C–15°C) for optimal
aging, or in the fridge to preserve its current flavor. It can last for 3–10
years or more if properly sealed.
